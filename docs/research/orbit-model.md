### A11 → `docs/research/orbit-model.md` (seed; M5, M7 and M9 L2 add sourced rows)
- **Aim.** Find the orbit ("location") for Starmind that minimizes impact on the chosen chip and maximizes lifetime. A location is a circular orbit: altitude, inclination, and for SSO the LTAN.
- **AI1 facts** (from A1):
  - The orbit is sun-synchronous (official).
  - No AI1 altitude is published. Any default altitude is an assumption supplied by Aiden in M5.
  - 500–2,000 km is the FCC constellation filing range and is labeled that way.
- **SSO.** The inclination follows from the altitude through the J2 nodal-precession condition. μ, R_E, J2 and the required precession rate are sourced at M5 L2(a). LTAN presets: dawn-dusk = 06:00/18:00 and noon-midnight = 12:00/00:00 (definitions).
- **Orbit-averaged environment (M5).**
  - SAA and auroral/outer-belt exposure fractions
  - eclipse fraction (sun position + shadow model, sourced at L2(d))
  - density from a pymsis-precomputed table (L2(c))
  - dose from a cited dose-vs-altitude/inclination table (L2(b)), else an `estimate` scaled from the 750 rad(Si)/5-yr anchor
- **Lifetime.**
  - time-to-TID = TID limit ÷ annual dose
  - drag-decay time from da/dt = −ρ·(Cd·A/m)·√(μ·a) down to an end-of-life altitude
  - lifetime = the min of the two, with the binding limit named
  - AI1 mass, drag area, Cd and end-of-life altitude: `UNVERIFIED` until sourced; otherwise user inputs labeled `estimate`
  - Candidate *derived* solar-array area: 210 kW ÷ 250 W/m² = 840 m², from the spacex.com sheet. The reading is confirmed at M5 L2(f).
- **Long-range vs short-term (rule).** Long-range orbit choice (optimizer, multi-year lifetime) uses **climatology**: storm frequency by size across the OMNI history and solar-cycle phase (M7). It **never** uses the short-term forecaster. The short-term forecaster drives Best Move, the replays and scenarios.
- **Transfer (M7).** Coplanar Hohmann between circular radii r1 → r2, using WGS 84 μ and R_E from `lib/engine/orbit/constants.ts`:
  - Δv1 = √(μ/r1)·(√(2r2/(r1+r2)) − 1)
  - Δv2 = √(μ/r2)·(1 − √(2r1/(r1+r2)))
  - Plane change, LTAN change and drag are ignored. The animation is labeled ILLUSTRATIVE and isn't a maneuver plan.
  - Worked check: 300 km to 35,786 km with those constants is 3.893 km/s, which rounds to 3.89 km/s. This is the plan formula, not a second printed table.
- **Climatology phase (M7).** Sunspot R was not parsed. Phase is an estimate from F10.7: under 80 sfu low, 80–150 mid, 150 and above high. It is not forecast skill.
- **Scenario (M9) rules.**
  - Outputs are labeled SCENARIO.
  - Input bounds are the observed extremes in OMNI (1995+) and the DONKI CME history (`data/scenario/ranges.json`).
  - CME → L1 translation per M9 L2(c), else the direct step profile labeled `estimate`.

BLOCKING: no

### M5 estimates recorded with the build

These are not in the L2 tables. Each one is an `estimate`.

- SSO test tolerance: 0.05°. Residuals of the J2-only inclination against the two L2(g) references are reported by the unit test.
- Propagation step: 72 samples per orbit. Averaging window: 24 Earth-rotation phases, one orbit each. Annual eclipse sample: 12 ecliptic longitudes.
- Shell grouping, applied to `data/snapshots/celestrak_gp.json`: round inclination to 0.1°, 1 km altitude bins, ignore bins under 20 objects, split a shell when dense bins are more than 3 km apart. Altitude uses two-body mean motion with the sourced μ and equatorial R_E. The resulting mean is the demo orbit. It is not an AI1 altitude.
- Obliquity 23.439° and Earth rotation 7.2921150×10^−5 rad/s. The NOAA page names Meeus and does not print the equations, so the sun direction is this labeled estimate plus the sourced 0.9856 deg/day rate.
- Density grid: altitude 100–2000 km step 25 km; F10.7 70, 100, 150, 200, 250; Ap 4, 15, 40, 80. Fixed date 2020-06-21, latitude 0, longitude 0, F10.7a set equal to F10.7, and all seven Ap slots set to the daily Ap.
- Vehicle inputs, because AI1 mass, drag area, Cd, and end-of-life altitude are unpublished: mass 1000 kg, drag area 10 m², Cd 2.2, end-of-life altitude 120 km. These are not Starlink values. The 840 m² figure is the confirmed solar-array reading and is not a drag area.
- Non-SSO RAAN 0°. No LTAN is taken from the Starlink snapshot.
- Dose has no SPENVIS table. Annual dose is the 750 rad(Si)/5 yr anchor scaled by SAA fraction. The anchor orbit is UNVERIFIED, so every dose and TID lifetime stays an `estimate`.

## R1 dose grid and storm zones (2026-10-04)

Aiden asked to skip the full L2 research pass for these ("it doesn't have to be most accurate"). Every row below is an `estimate` or `UNVERIFIED` until a researcher pass confirms it.
